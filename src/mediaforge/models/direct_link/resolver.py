"""Shared low-level helpers for the Direct Link embed-host resolution
pipeline: which hosts MediaForge can resolve itself (:func:`fast_providers`),
the default desktop User-Agent, and :func:`resolve_stream_for_provider` --
the "call this host's extractor" step. Used by probe.py's
discover_and_resolve().

The host list is derived at runtime instead of being hard-coded: every name
the hoster-domain table (models/megakino_to/scraper.py's ``_HOSTER_DOMAINS``,
the authoritative domain-substring -> provider-name mapping) knows about is
kept if -- and only if -- MediaForge actually has a working extractor for it
under extractors/provider/. Names whose extractor is only a stub (raises
NotImplementedError) drop out on their own, so enabling a new provider is
enough to make Direct Link pick it up too.

Order matters: candidates are tried in the user's configured provider order
(Settings -> Provider order, see web/runtime_state.get_provider_order()), and
only when *no* supported provider can resolve the link does Direct Link fall
back to yt-dlp's generic extraction.
